# EmuRox
The plan is to evolve this into a working [NES](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_Entertainment_System) emulator so I'm developing the emulation of the [6502 processor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOS_Technology_6502) without BCD mode for now.  If/When I get that working, I'll expand the 6502 and move onto another 6502 system (Atari 2600, Commodore 64...) then perhaps add processors and more emulated hardware, in theory, creating a pluggable multi-emulator. So far we have:-

 - An almost complete Ricoh 2A03 (NES second source version of the 6502)
 - iNES 1.0 ROM reading
 - The beginnings of a Ricoh 2C02 processor
 - An in production NES to hold it all 


## Origins
This project came about as I wanted a larger scale project to concentrate on building readable, highly tested code that I can refactor as much as I fancy.  That would allow me to play with ticket management, CI, testing, and any other products and learn what works and and what doesn't.  
Everytime I finish writing a section I realise that there were better ways to do it and in a commercial environment, that's accepted as technical debt and it's on to the next.  In this environment I can iterate as much as I like.

## 6502 and progress towards a working NES...

Feature development is on a little bit of a lull at the moment.  I went quite hard at it to begin with and life got a little hectic.  I need some time to do proper investigation of the PPU and then some exploratory coding and design which my work/personal life isn't allowing at this moment. Should be too long before I'm back bashing at it.

Any small chunks of time I get, I'm looking into improving on what's already written.  For example:-
 
  - getting rid of java performed arithmetic (usually in `+`/`-` cases) in favor of ALU performed arithmetic (and moving to an ALU class)
  - compressing the data driven tests;  extracting out common patterns, etc
  - abstracting away bytes into a custom class so that I don't need workarounds for Java types
  - making the 6502 emulator, compiler and debugger available to 6502 community for testing.  
  
BCD and proper timing is a thing for another day as my first objective for now, is the NES emulator.

## Development & Testing

The plan was to develop in a TDD (Test Driven Development) centric way, that is via Red-Green testing; i.e. writing failing/red tests that describe functionality then writing that functionality to make the tests pass/green and iteratively writing a complete application.
 
#### Current technologies

 _Technologies that I have used, liked and continued to use as part of the project..._

 - [Trello](https://trello.com/b/ZWcFxEu3/emurox) for work breakdown and project management. 
 - [Java](https://www.java.com/)/[JUnit](http://junit.org/junit4/) for basic functionality tests, adding mocks and more expressive syntax with [Mockito](http://site.mockito.org/).  This includes features such as [Theories](http://junit.org/junit4/javadoc/4.12/org/junit/experimental/theories/Theories.html).  
 - [Groovy](http://www.groovy-lang.org/)/[Spock](http://spockframework.org/) for [data-driven tests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data-driven_testing), adding mocks and more expressive syntax with [Hamcrest](http://hamcrest.org/).  For covering various variations of class creation and method use in a clear, concise way that JUnit struggles with.  
 - [junit-quickcheck](https://github.com/pholser/junit-quickcheck) and [Spock Genesis](https://github.com/Bijnagte/spock-genesis) for [property-based testing](http://blog.jessitron.com/2013/04/property-based-testing-what-is-it.html) in Java and Groovy respectively.
 - [JUnit Theory Suite](https://github.com/richard-melvin/junit-theory-suite) for unrolling [JUnit](http://junit.org/junit4/) [Theories](http://junit.org/junit4/javadoc/4.12/org/junit/experimental/theories/Theories.html).  This will unroll all data points combinatorially to a [Theory](http://junit.org/junit4/javadoc/4.12/org/junit/experimental/theories/Theories.html)
 - [TravisCI](https://travis-ci.org/) for [continuous integration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration) & build status GitHub Shield, making sure my build always builds and my tests always pass.
 - [Pitest](http://pitest.org/) reports. To allow us to use [mutation testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation_testing) to validate and improve our ([Spock](http://spockframework.org/) & [JUnit](http://junit.org/junit4/)) unit tests.  The Pitest GitHub shield is a [self made Python program](https://rossdrew.github.io//pitest-ci/).
 - [JaCoCo](http://www.eclemma.org/jacoco/) reports. To allow us to strive for high [code coverage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_coverage).  Mainly for the GitHub shield using [CodeCov](https://codecov.io). 
 - Static analysis done in my development environment on [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) and online (including GitHub shield) by [Codeacy](https://www.codacy.com/). 

#### Investigated technologies 

 _Technologies that I have used yet disliked or haven't saw a place for them in my project for whatever reason..._

 - [JParams toStringTester](https://github.com/jparams/to-string-tester) for `toString` testing but it didn't seem to work very well, I filed an [issue](https://github.com/jparams/to-string-tester/issues/1) but the project has since been archived.
 - [JUnit QuickTheories](https://github.com/ncredinburgh/QuickTheories) for property based testing but it's much more verbose for no added benefit over [junit-quickcheck](https://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwjq4-PF-aPSAhWHDsAKHV17BCIQFggaMAA&url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fpholser%2Fjunit-quickcheck&usg=AFQjCNE37M0yEi68OG8Hr7y1MDoJwcLOaQ&sig2=AUpnbmKM5Sk9efhw1r-bKw&bvm=bv.147448319,d.d2s)
 - [Spockito](https://github.com/tools4j/spockito) to give the ability to unroll [JUnit](http://junit.org/junit4/) [Theories](http://junit.org/junit4/javadoc/4.12/org/junit/experimental/theories/Theories.html) like in [Spock](http://spockframework.org/) data-driven tests but I'm not a big fan of the syntax and attaches `@DataPoint`s to the methods.  It would be great for adding data-driven tests if you were limited to [JUnit](http://junit.org/junit4/), however
 - [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) for testing and various testing frameworks like [Spek](https://github.com/spekframework/spek) and [kotlintest](https://github.com/kotlintest/kotlintest) but it offers nothing I don't already have and property/data-driven/theory testing is pretty ugly and/or weak.

### Problems

###### Javas unsigned byte problem. 
 Java bytes are signed, meaning it's a pain to deal with them.  Sometimes we want to deal with raw bytes such as memory read and writes, sometimes we want to have them signed and later in BCD mode.
###### JaCoCo coverage in String based switch 
 [JaCoCo](http://www.eclemma.org/jacoco/) doesn't report coverage of `String` based `switch` statements [well](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/42642840/why-is-jacoco-not-covering-my-switch-statements)
 
### Sources
 - StackOverflow as always has been a huge help, specifically [Godin](http://stackoverflow.com/users/244993/godin), also a developer of [JaCoCo](http://www.eclemma.org/jacoco/) for his help.  eg. [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/42642840/why-is-jacoco-not-covering-my-switch-statements) & [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/41652981/why-does-jacoco-ignore-myspock-tests-yet-sees-my-junit-tests) 
 - The [6502 Programming](https://www.facebook.com/groups/6502CPU/) Facebook group has been invaluable in resolving very specific questions 
 - I'm planning on reaching out to communities for code reviews (your comments are always welcome btw), another pair of eyes is always helpful, although so far these have proven to be unfruitful:-
    - [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/reviewmycode/comments/5oorz1/java_6502_emulator/)
    - [Stack Exchange](http://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/154600/op-code-decoding-in-an-emulator) 
 
## Get involved 
Found my project interesting or used it in some way?  Contribute by showing your appreciation with a [frosty beverage](https://beerpay.io/rossdrew/emuRox).  In my case this will go towards an [Old Fashioned](https://www.instagram.com/p/BUzyDHOAzkI/?taken-by=ross_drew) but as far as I'm aware there is no Spirit/Bourbon/WhiskeyPay.
  
Or even [make a feature suggestion](https://beerpay.io/rossdrew/emuRox?focus=wish) if you are so inclined.

Lastly, feel free to volunteer solutions, fixes, improvements, pull requests, documentation, technology suggestions.  If you are a JavaFX/Swing guru, I'd love to see a better UI on this.  Just note that I'm trying to make this, as well as a working project, a highly tested, nice codebase to work on.
